# babbler

An implementation of a fully-coupled problem with porous flow, heat conduction, and solid mechanics. This is an implementation of the MOOSE [Tutorial 1: Application Development](https://mooseframework.org/getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/tutorial01_app_development/).

This application is designed to teach people the core concepts of MOOSE for creating custom applications. The application name "babbler" is named in reference to the [pied babblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_pied_babbler), which is one animial known to teach its young [(Thorton and Raihani, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.014). A "babbler" is also defined as a ["a person who talks constantly"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/babbler), which in context of the live training is also true for the MOOSE team. :)
